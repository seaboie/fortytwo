## command line  

`ls -mtp`  

```bash
-m Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by commas.  

-t Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first).  If two files have the same modification timestamp, sort their names in ascending lexicographical order.  The -r option reverses both of these sort orders.  

-p Write a slash (‘/’) after each filename if that file is a directory.
```
